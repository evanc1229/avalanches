## Background and Motivation
In the United States, there are on average 27 avalanche realated deaths per year and countless more avalanche realated injuries. This death count is concentrated 
in about 8 states, Utah being in the top 4 of those states for highest death count. While this number may seem small, so is the winter backcountry recreation
community. As this community grows, so do the number of backcountry travel related deaths. Because this is a growing issue, it is increasingly more
important to analyze our exisitng avalanche data to give people the ability to make more informed, and thus life saving decisions, when traveling
in the backcountry.
