* Project Title: Utah Avalanches
* Github Repo: https://github.com/evanc1229/utah_avalanches



## Background and Motivation
In the United States, there are on average 27 avalanche realated deaths per year and countless more avalanche realated injuries. This death count is 
concentrated in about 8 states, Utah being in the top 4 of those states for highest death count. While this number may seem small, so is the winter 
backcountry recreation community. As this community grows, so do the number of backcountry travel related deaths. Because this is a growing issue, it is 
increasingly more important to analyze our exisitng avalanche data to give people the ability to make more informed, and thus life saving decisions, when 
traveling in the backcountry. Our group was interested in this for the above stated reasons and because memeber(s) of our group are frequently in 
backcountry avalanche terrain and would like a better tool for visually understanding this dataset that is widely used by the backcountry community.

## Project Objectives
Our primary objectives are as follows and are ordered by importance: 1) Create an interactive map that shows the location of avalanches in various avalanche regions of utah, 2) Create clickable icons for each avalanche that dispaly information about what occured, 3) use the avalable data from each avalanche to create a 'profile' of visualizations based on the information avaialbe and the avalanche type.
