- Add 2nd page as hideable sidebar on the first page (i.e. some expanding tab/drawer to pull out various charts and graphs)
	- (Maybe consider doing something similar with the 3rd page as well?)
- Keep as a design principle: "how will someone who doesn't know anything about the viz understand how to use it"
- Tell a story with your presentation
	- Textboxes
	- "Crowdsourced"
- Use color/shapes for encoding other stuff
- Put year-axis on timeselect
- Tooltips can be big and have lots of info, including text descriptions
- Unless we wanna rewrite everything in React, the timeselect update will likely just have to be the simple solution we came up with first
- When zoomed out, joined nearby circles and label them with counts) ("semantic zoom")
